            <p className="text-justify "> <span className="font-bold">1. What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side? </span><br />
                Ans: A refresh token just helps you re-validate a user without them having to re-enter their login credentials multiple <times className="br"></times> The access token is re-issued, provided the refresh token is a valid one requesting permission to access confidential resources. <br /> <br />
                The main purpose of using a refresh token is to considerably shorten the life of an access token. The refresh token can then later be used to authenticate the user as and when required by the application without running into problems such as cookies being blocked, etc. If that does not make much sense, think of it this way:

                When a browser makes a request to an API endpoint to use a resource provided only to authenticated users, the application would require the credentials of the user. And upon authentication (login), the application on the user is browser is granted access to the resource. This access is provided by sharing an access token with the user is browser so that subsequent API calls from the browser -- which requires the credentials can be sent without any hassle.

                Now in the process of sharing the access token with the user, the system may also provide a refresh token that would later authenticate the user while making the subsequent API calls even if the access token has expired by requesting a new access token when required.

                Hence, the refresh tokens allow applications to obtain new access tokens utilizing mere API calls without any need of having users approve cookies, login multiple times, etc.

                2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
            </span> <br />

                SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two different types of database management systems, each with its own set of advantages and use cases. Here is a comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases based on various criteria: <br />

                1. Data Structure:
                SQL Databases:

                SQL databases are based on a predefined schema.
                Data is organized into tables with fixed columns and data types.
                Schema defines the structure of the data, including relationships between tables.
                NoSQL Databases:

                NoSQL databases are schema-less.
                Data is stored in various formats: key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-family, or graph databases.
                Each record can have different fields, and new fields can be added without altering existing records. <br />
                2. Scalability:
                SQL Databases:

                SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.
                Scaling beyond a certain point usually involves complex and costly setups, such as database sharding.
                NoSQL Databases:

                NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, allowing you to handle more traffic by adding more servers to your NoSQL database.
                NoSQL databases are designed to scale out across many servers, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads. <br />
                3. ACID Transactions:
                SQL Databases:

                SQL databases follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
                ACID transactions provide reliability in terms of data consistency and integrity.
                NoSQL Databases:

                NoSQL databases often sacrifice ACID transactions for performance and scalability.
                Many NoSQL databases offer eventual consistency, which means that after a period of time, all nodes in the system will have the same data. <br />
                4. Complex Queries:
                SQL Databases:

                SQL databases are powerful for complex queries involving multiple tables.
                They support JOIN operations, making it easier to fetch data from related tables.
                NoSQL Databases:

                NoSQL databases are not as proficient at handling complex queries, especially across multiple data stores.
                Queries are typically simple and efficient but may lack the advanced querying capabilities of SQL databases. <br />

                5. Use Cases:
                SQL Databases:

                Suitable for applications where data structure is fixed and unlikely to change frequently.
                Good for applications requiring complex queries and transactions, such as financial applications and traditional relational database use cases. <br />
                NoSQL Databases:

                Suitable for applications with evolving, schema-less, or semi-structured data, like social media, mobile apps, and real-time analytics.
                Ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON, XML, or key-value pairs. <br />
                In summary, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application. SQL databases provide strong consistency and are best suited for applications where data integrity and complex querying are critical. NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability, making them suitable for handling large volumes of dynamic, unstructured data in distributed and high-availability environments.

                4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
            </span>
                <br />
                MongoDB Aggregation Framework: <br />

                The MongoDB Aggregation Framework is a powerful tool for performing data transformations and computations on the data stored in a MongoDB database. It allows you to filter, transform, group, sort, join, and project your data in various ways, similar to SQL's GROUP BY and other aggregation functions. Aggregation pipelines allow data processing to be performed at the database level, making it more efficient and flexible. <br /> <br />

                How Aggregation Works: <br />
                Aggregation in MongoDB works through the concept of pipelines. A pipeline is an array of stages, where each stage performs a specific operation on the data. The output of one stage becomes the input for the next stage in the pipeline.
